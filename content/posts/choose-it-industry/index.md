### My Journey into Software Engineering!!

> "As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a software engineer."

Just kidding, guys üòÖ. Nope, this is not the case for me. I am just quoting the famous dialogue from *Goodfellas*.

For me, I was introduced to programming in the year **2009** when I joined my higher secondary schooling. It was **C++**, running in its famous blue IDE with large fonts and everything, that too on an old **Windows XP** machine. At that time, I didn't have a PC at home. To be honest, I didn't find programming that amusing in those days. I was trying to learn code by heart instead of understanding the language itself. 

I got a small spark at the end of schooling but was still in a very confused state about whether this could be my future.

In **2011**, I joined college to pursue my degree, and there things were different. I got introduced to **Linux** machines. There was this black terminal with the "forever" blinking cursor, and we needed to connect to the college's server using the `telnet` command to write codes. I was introduced to the **VIM** editor, and suddenly, a whole new world was introduced to me. 

I learned **C**, I learned **Python**, I learned **Linux**. The college library and my professors helped me a lot. I learned the fundamentals of software engineering from the college. **Data structures** and **algorithms** made me wonder, and implementing them in code made me happy.

I realized there is more to programming than just printing `"hello world!"` on the screen. And there are a lot of opportunities here where I can contribute. I realized that those contributions will make a better future for human beings. That's when I decided this is my future. 

After college, I never applied for any **government jobs**, I never applied for any **bank jobs** where the degree is a minimum qualification, and lots of my friends were applying for it. When college was done, I was decided that **this is my future**, **this is my career**, I enjoy this stuff, and it makes me happy.

And this is my **9th year** in the industry as a software engineer, and I am more than happy with my work and everything it gives. ‚ù§Ô∏è

What more could you ask for? üòä
